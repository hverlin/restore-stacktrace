                                            SOURCE AGREEMENT

BY USING THE TRIFACTA SOFTWARE IN ANY MANNER, YOU AND YOUR COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION (COLLECTIVELY, "USER") AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF TO BE BOUND BY AND A PARTY TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS.

1.  User shall not, and shall not authorize any third party to: (i) sublicense, use or duplicate the Trifacta Software, or any portion thereof, except as expressly authorized in this Agreement; (ii) use the Trifacta Software by, or for the benefit of any third party; (iii) modify, translate, or prepare derivative works based upon the Trifacta Software; (iv) reverse-compile or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Trifacta Software, except to the extent expressly required to be permitted by applicable law;  (v) rent, lease, loan, sell, transfer, or distribute the Trifacta Software, or any copy or portion thereof, to any other person or entity; and/or (vi) alter, remove, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices or confidentiality legend on or in the Trifacta Software.  Trifacta reserves all right, title and interests in and to the Trifacta Software and any derivative works derived therefrom, and all intellectual property rights therein. All suggestions or feedback provided by User or its employees, contractors or other agents to Trifacta with respect to the Trifacta Software shall be Trifacta’s property and deemed Confidential Information of Trifacta, and User hereby assigns the same to Trifacta.

2.  "Confidential Information" means any non-public data, information and other materials regarding the products, services or business of Trifacta provided to User where such information is marked or otherwise communicated as being "proprietary" or "confidential" or the like, or where such information should, by its nature, be reasonably considered to be confidential and/or proprietary.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Trifacta Software, any performance data, benchmark results, and technical information relating thereto, any documentation, Trifacta's pricing information and the terms and conditions of this Agreement (but not its existence) shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Trifacta.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information which:  (i) is already known to User prior to disclosure by Trifacta; (ii) becomes publicly available without fault of User; (iii) is rightfully obtained by User from a third party without restriction as to disclosure, or is approved for release by written authorization of Trifacta; or (iv) is required to be disclosed by law or governmental regulation, provided that User provides reasonable notice to Trifacta of such required disclosure and reasonably cooperates with Trifacta in limiting such disclosure.  User agrees to keep the Confidential Information of Trifacta in confidence and not to use such Confidential Information except in performing hereunder.  Except as expressly authorized herein, User agrees to: (i) treat all Confidential Information of Trifacta in the same manner as it treats its own similar proprietary information, but in no case will the degree of care be less than reasonable care; and (ii) disclose Trifacta's Confidential Information only to those employees and contractors of User who have a need to know such information for the purposes of this Agreement, provided that any such employee and contractor shall be subject to a binding written agreement with respect to such Confidential Information at least as restrictive as the terms of this Agreement, and User shall indemnify and hold Trifacta harmless for any non-compliance of such employee or third party with the terms of this Agreement.

3.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY WARRANTED HEREIN, THE TRIFACTA SOFTWARE AND ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY TRIFACTA HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  TRIFACTA DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE TRIFACTA SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR SERVICES WILL MEET USER’S REQUIREMENTS.  NEITHER TRIFACTA NOR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR COSTS, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR COSTS; AND (B) IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF TRIFACTA,  OR ANY THIRD PARTY LICENSORS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY) EXCEED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($10,000).

4.  Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this Agreement are assignable or transferable by User, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California, excluding rules governing conflict of law and choice of law.  The federal and state courts within San Francisco, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of this Agreement.  Each party hereto expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts and service of process being affected upon it by registered mail and sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this Agreement.  The parties agree that the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 1980) and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act or similar federal or state laws or regulations shall not apply to this Agreement nor to any dispute or transaction arising out of this Agreement. The party prevailing in any dispute under this Agreement shall be entitled to its costs and legal fees.

5.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any previous communications, representations or agreements whether oral or written regarding such subject matter. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

6.  This Agreement shall be effective as of the date User receives the Trifacta Software (the “Effective Date”) and may be terminated by Trifacta upon five (5) days written notice with or without cause.  Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement: (i) all licenses and rights granted by Trifacta to User hereunder shall terminate; and (ii) User will cease all use of the Trifacta Software; and (iii) and User shall immediately return to Trifacta the Trifacta Software, all duplicates, and any Trifacta Confidential Information.  Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

7.  User shall comply with all export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or other United States or foreign agency or authority, and not to export, or allow the export or re-export of the Trifacta Software in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations. By downloading or using the Trifacta Software, User agrees to the foregoing and User represents and warrants that User is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any restricted country or on any such list.

8.  EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED FOR BASES OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
